v3.0.0 [29 February 2024]

Note: Initial changes from previous generation.

However, it is not a big deal, it is just a small improvement than the previous version
with the new GUI system based on JE 1.20.2.

This is just a new beginning...

[Additions]
[+] New GUI Texture System from JE 1.20.5 Snapshots, but no every texture can have
		desired resolution automatically, still, you must review "_global_variables.json"!
[+] Crafter Redstone Screen (From 1.21 Snapshots).
[+] Customize Touch Controls (Experimental).

[Temporarily Removed]
[-] Legacy container screens (Villager v1 and Smithing Table v1)
[-] Realms Sections
Note: These screens will be back in the next update, otherwise... Ore UI version is probably implemented... D:
